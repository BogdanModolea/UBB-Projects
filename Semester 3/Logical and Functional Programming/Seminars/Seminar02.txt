Tail recursion:
	1) Uniq solution
	2) Recursive call is the last call


suma([1, 2, 3], _) -> 
	-> call for s([1, 2, 3], _) -> call for s([2, 3], _) -> call for s([3], _) -> call for s([], 0)
			then going back
							    					3 + 0
								3 + 2				s([3], 3)
				1 + 5				s([2, 3], 5)
			s([1, 2, 3], 6)

=> 6
